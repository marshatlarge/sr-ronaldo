**Project Overview**

This is a basic web application made with vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML that visualizes Cristiano Ronaldo's statistics in a table, including goals, assists, minutes played, and goals per 90 minutes, across various competitions and seasons.

Given more time, I would have implemented some tests and undergo further refactoring for maintainability.
